# Home_assignment_programmingcourse
A home assignment about MRI data on psychosis. 

Welcome to my project **Psychosis in MRI**./n
My name is Julie Folkerts./n
Date of completion: 03-12-2025./n
Link to the Neurosynth page on psychosis: https://neurosynth.org/locations/0_0_0_6/

This repository contains the code and analysis of my home assignment for the programming course. This project is about creating Python code to visualize fMRI data on a self-selected topic, in my case psychosis. By using the data from https://neurosynth.org/ I created a functional connectivity statisitical map and a histogram of voxel intensities of the fMRI scans on psyschosis.

1. **Data used**
   - Anatomical MRI file ('anatomical.nii')
   - Functional connectivity file ('functional_connectivitiy_0_0_0.nii')
2. **Notebook**
   - The notebook used is the following file: 'Home_assignment_programmingcourse.ipynb'
  
Python packages used:
